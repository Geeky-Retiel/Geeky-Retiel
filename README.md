"Beware of the man who speaks in hands"

Hi, you may call me Geeky. ðŸ‘‹

### little incoherent rambling:
Though a beginner, this one strives to achieve greatness in all that is intertwined with the wonderful world of coding and debugging, at least all that this one dares to know.

To specify, I seek no salvation in getting, but rather having. With having, this one obviously defines knowing, knowing not in merely remembering, but rather, feeling, and therefore ascending into human heaven with wisdom transcending the foreign languages that this one was pushed to learn.
Though, what doest my owns darest to speak of? Shallest thee not walk off to view what thinest fate speaks to? 

Worry not, minest present words may rot to dog water, still, things mine owns doest, even there, where rays of light and dark trace ones path and burns ones eyes, showest naythn but one owns heart to fun, speakth, hearth and nay of other delusioned abstractions of humankind.

Beyond the scope of light, beyond the reach of Dark...what could possibly await us? And yet, we seek it, insatiably... such is our fate. 
(Last one ist actually a quote from Dark Souls)
